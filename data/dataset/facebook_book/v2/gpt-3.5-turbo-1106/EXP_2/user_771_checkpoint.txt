Based on user 771's liking of The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, I would recommend The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien as a top recommendation. Additionally, considering the user's liking of The Guns of the South by Harry Turtledove, I would suggest World War Z as another potential recommendation. Finally, given the user's enjoyment of The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas and Auguste Maquet, I would recommend Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky as a potential read.
